## **Project Title**

*NFT Art Marketplace* — A decentralized platform for minting, buying, and selling unique digital artworks as NFTs.

---

## **Project Description**

The NFT Art Marketplace is a fully decentralized application built on Ethereum that enables artists and collectors to create, list, and trade unique digital art pieces securely and transparently. Powered by smart contracts, this marketplace removes intermediaries and ensures true ownership and provenance of digital assets.

Artists can mint NFTs representing their digital artwork with associated metadata, set sale prices, and list them directly on the marketplace. Buyers can browse available NFTs, purchase them using Ether, and seamlessly transfer ownership on-chain without third-party involvement.

By leveraging blockchain’s immutability and transparency, this platform fosters trust between creators and collectors, eliminates censorship, and opens global access to digital art commerce.

---

## **Project Vision**

Our vision is to democratize digital art ownership and commerce by providing an open, censorship-resistant marketplace where artists can showcase their creativity without barriers, and collectors can confidently invest in unique digital assets with verifiable provenance.

The NFT Art Marketplace aims to empower creators worldwide by eliminating reliance on centralized platforms that often impose high fees, restrict access, or control listings. With decentralized ownership and secure transactions, the platform will foster a vibrant, global community of artists and collectors.
